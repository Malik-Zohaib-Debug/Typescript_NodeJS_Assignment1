//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at 
//the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" 
//and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is 
//displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
